# 🏔️ Isometric Game Agent Skills

**Production-grade AI agent skills for building isometric games — from AI-generated art to the rendering engine.**

The missing toolkit that teaches AI coding agents how senior game artists and engine programmers actually build isometric worlds: seamless tiles, depth-sorted sprites, grid math, and the whole asset pipeline.

## Why this exists

AI coding agents are great at React and terrible at isometric games. They generate tiles that do not align, sprites in 5 different styles, characters that render behind walls, and renderers that drop to 12fps. Not because the models are weak — because nobody wrote down **how an experienced isometric dev actually works**.

This repo is that knowledge, encoded as **SKILL.md** files an agent can load on demand. Point Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex at it and your agent suddenly builds isometric worlds like it has shipped three of them.

> New here? Start with the meta-skill **[using-isometric-skills](skills/using-isometric-skills/SKILL.md)** — it routes any incoming task to the right workflow.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xheycat/isometric-game-skills.git
```

Then wire it into your agent (pick your tool):

| Tool | How to install |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | Copy any `skills/<name>/` folder into `.claude/skills/` in your project. |
| **Cursor** | See [`docs/cursor-setup.md`](docs/cursor-setup.md) — add the skill body to project rules. |
| **Codex / other** | Paste the relevant `SKILL.md` into your agent's context or skills folder. |

Full walkthrough: [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md).

## 🎮 Live Demo

**▶️ [Play it live in your browser](https://0xheycat.github.io/isometric-game-skills/demo/)** — hosted on GitHub Pages, no install. Drag to pan, scroll to zoom, toggle 🖼️ Sprites.

A single-file, dependency-free Canvas2D isometric renderer lives in [`demo/`](demo/) — **proof these skills are real, not theory**. Procedural terrain, depth-sorted objects, tile picking, and a pan/zoom camera, all in one HTML file.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080   # then open http://localhost:8080/demo/
```

It directly exercises six skills: `isometric-grid-math`, `canvas2d-isometric-renderer`, `depth-sorting-occlusion`, `tilemap-data-format`, `tile-picking-interaction`, and `camera-pan-zoom-controls`. See [`demo/README.md`](demo/README.md).

## 🗺️ How it all fits together

These aren't 20 loose tips — they chain into one pipeline that takes an agent from an empty folder to a **playable isometric scene**. Proof, not theory.

![Pipeline: all 20 skills from setup to playable scene](assets/pipeline.svg)

- 🎯 **[GOAL.md](GOAL.md)** — the measurable Definition of Done. When every box is checked, the goal is *achieved*.
- 🏗️ **[docs/build-a-game.md](docs/build-a-game.md)** — the capstone walkthrough that runs **all 20 skills** in order, with an acceptance test per phase.
- ✅ **[`scripts/validate_skills.py`](scripts/validate_skills.py)** — CI-enforced check that every `SKILL.md` is well-formed (the `skills valid` badge above). Machine-readable index: [`skills.json`](skills.json).
- 🧮 **[`engine/iso.js`](engine/iso.js)** — the canonical 2:1 iso math (grid↔screen, picking, depth sort) with **passing unit tests** ([`engine/iso.test.mjs`](engine/iso.test.mjs), run in CI). The math is *tested*, not asserted.
- 🗂️ **[`examples/sample-map.json`](examples/sample-map.json)** — a hand-authored map in the `tilemap-data-format`. Render it headless with [`examples/render-map.mjs`](examples/render-map.mjs) → [`sample-map.svg`](examples/sample-map.svg) (drawn by the tested engine, no browser).

## 📐 How Skills Work

Each skill is a single `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter and a fixed anatomy designed to **stop an agent from cutting corners**:

- **Frontmatter** — `name` + a `description` that starts with "Use when…" so agents auto-select it.
- **Process** — numbered, non-negotiable steps (process, not prose).
- **Rationalizations** — the excuses an agent makes, paired with the reality, so it cannot talk itself out of doing the work.
- **Red Flags** — stop conditions that mean you are about to ship something broken.
- **Verification** — a checklist; you are not done until every box is checked.

Read the full spec in [`docs/skill-anatomy.md`](docs/skill-anatomy.md).

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs welcome — new skills, fixes, and screenshots all help. Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) and use the [new-skill issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-skill.md) to propose one. Every skill must follow the anatomy and ship with a verification checklist.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] Core 20 skills (art -> engine -> gameplay -> ship)
- [x] Godot 4 engine reference pack ([godot4-isometric-tilemap](skills/godot4-isometric-tilemap/SKILL.md)) — Phaser / Unity next
- [ ] Downloadable starter tile set (CC0)
- [ ] Web playground to preview tile sets
- [ ] Video walkthroughs per skill
